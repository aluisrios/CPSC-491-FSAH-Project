# Abstract
There has been multiple times when a student goes to college to pursue their career but,
in the end, they may walk out with a debt that will take a long time for them to pay off. There is
also a chance that students want to meet with a financial advisor, but when trying to contact one
or make an appointment with one, they are booked for weeks and even months. This
demonstrates that many people are not getting the help they need since an advisor can only help
so many people at one time. Furthermore, there are a great number of people who have no idea
what they’re doing and how to fill out a form. The aim of Financial Student Aid Helper (FSAH)
is to be able to help all students around the world be able to receive the help they need and to be
able to walk out of school with their dream job without needing to worry about the debt they’re
in. To be able to accomplish this goal FSAH is going to be inputted with every single possible
financial aid that exists for that specific country. The application is going to be able to help
students apply for any financial aid and explain any certain requirements that they may need to
meet to be able to apply for it.

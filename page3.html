            <p> A federal funded program that is the foundation of financial aid to undergraduates who demonstrate need. Students who demonstrate need must be U.S. citizens or eligible noncitizens.
                Your academic year award amount is determined from your expected family (EFC) that was calculated from your FAFSA.
                For the 2020-2021 school year, the EFC cut-off to be considered for Federal Pell Grant must be less than or equal to $6,345. Please review your Student Aid Report (SAR) to view your 2020-2021 EFC.
                Federal Pell Grant disbursements (i.e. payments) are based enrolled units at CSU Fullerton. Awards will be prorated if student is enrolled in less then full-time (under 12 units). In some instances a student enrolled in less than 12 units may lose eligibility for his/her Pell Grant, as EFC’s in the higher end of the Pell range do not allow for less than full-time awards.
                Limits: Lifetime Eligibility Used (LEU) apply, students are limited to a total of six full-time years, or 600.00%, of Pell Grant eligibility. More information can be found under the Eligibility tab.

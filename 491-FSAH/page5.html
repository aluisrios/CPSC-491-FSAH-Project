                The Middle Class Scholarship (MCS) is a California Student Aid Commission (CSACOpens in new window ) administered state program for undergraduates and students pursuing a teaching credential. 
                The 2021-22 State Budget introduced significant changes to the MCS program starting in the 2022-23 academic year. The new MCS program is referred to as MCS 2.0.
            </p>

            <h3> ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS</h3>

            <p>
                Middle Class Scholarship 2.0 is for eligible families with income and assets of up to $217,000 for 2023-24. Please see CSAC’s 2023-2024 MCS and Income and Asset CeilingsPDF File Opens in new window .
                Students must meet the following conditions:

                <blockquote>
                1. Be enrolled in an Undergraduate program, including students pursuing a teaching credential program. <br>

                2. Complete a Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) or California Dream Act Application (CADAA) by March 2nd. <br>

                3. Meet state Financial Aid requirements: Be a California resident; U.S. citizen, permanent resident or meet the requirements for non-resident tuition exemption (i.e., AB 540); 
                    maintain Satisfactory Academic Progress; not be in default on a student loan; and must not be incarcerated. <br>

                4. Qualify for a minimum amount of $90 per year based on the MCS formula. <br>
                </blockquote>
            </p>

            <h3> HOW IS THE MCS AMOUNT DETERMINED?</h3>
            <p> 
                Scholarship award amounts will vary by student and by school. The final award amount will be based on the number of students eligible for the MCS statewide and the funding allocated by the State Budget.
                Additionally, final awards are impacted by the number of units student is enrolled. Please see Disbursement Requirement to see how MCS is prorated according to units enrolled.

                MCS 2.0 looks at three components, the ‘available resources’ when determining the award amounts. These components make up the MCS formula.

                <blockquote>
                1. Student’s Cost of Attendance <br>

                2. Other available gift aid (i.e., federal, state, institutional or scholarship aid) <br>

                3. Student self-help contribution of $7,898 (applied to all students), and a parent contribution for dependent students with a household income of over $100,000, if applicable. <br>
                </blockquote>

                MCS 2.0 is subject to adjustments during the award year ; any changes to the above MCS formula may result in an MCS award amount adjustment. 
                Any additional financial aid offers received may result in reductions or loss of MCS eligibility, including but not limited to scholarships, state/federal grants, stipends, fee waivers, 
                etc.
            </p>
